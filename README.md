# PurpleItems - Minecraft Spigot Plugin

PurpleItems is a fun little plugin developed for **Spigot 1.18** that adds a handful of **custom items with special abilities** to your Minecraft server.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This plugin is **quite old** and was created as a personal project for experimentation. The code does not reflect modern development standards, and if written today, it would be implemented very differently.
